# Zero Shot Learning in Scene Graph Generation

Following [this paper]https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08319) and it's [code](https://github.com/yangxuntu/vrd), we added a zero-shot learning approach where our model could predict words even out of training data, by making the word predict word embedding instead of one-hot vector.
